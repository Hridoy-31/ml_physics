This report outlines some thoughts on the relationship between machine learning and non-equilibrium physics, specifically through the stochastic extension of Hopfield nets known as "restricted boltzmann machines" (RBM).  We propose an extension of the RBM to more directly parallel the circumstance of the non-equilibrium system drving by an energetically coupled driving signal, and comment on the possibility of training such an algorithm using recent results from non-equilibrium theory.
